TDD style message expectations; in both RSpec and MiniTest

Your Assignment
---------------

In most circumstances like this, there's a sort of MessageBoard. Let's create
the idea of a MessageBoard class that both the engineer and the conductor know
about.

1. When the conductor sees trouble, the conductor tells the `message_board` to slow down
2. When the engineer slows down, the engineer tells the `message_board` `confirm_slow_down`

Use whichever mocking tool you liked the best or are interested in. If you
don't know what to choose, go with RSpec.
